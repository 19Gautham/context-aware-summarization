            "📚 Evidence: The text states that Red Marauder won the 2001 Grand National. It also states that only four horses completed the race, implying many were non-finishers. It is given that Red Marauder won the 2001 Grand National, and the question asks when this winner of 2001 was a non-finisher in 2000, so as Red Marauder won the 2001 grand national, and only four horses finished in that year, he clearly was not a non-finisher in the 2000 grand national. I have incorrectly provided this information as the question specifically asks when the non-finisher at the Grand National of 2000 with jockey Richard Guest win the Grand National. To answer the question correctly, the information about Red Marauder winning in 2001 is not relevant. Richard Guest did ride a non-finisher in 2000. No information in the text is available to deduce when this particular non-finisher subsequently won the Grand National.

Additionally, it notes that since 2000, Belmopan has been one of two settlements in Belize to hold official city status, *along with* Belize City.

            "📚 Evidence: The description states that circumpolar stars for a given latitude φ have declinations greater than 90° - φ in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that a star's circumpolar nature depends on the observer's latitude. As you move towards the North Pole (latitude increases), the value of 90° - φ decreases. Therefore, more stars become circumpolar. Conversely, as you move towards the equator (latitude decreases), the value of 90° - φ increases, and fewer stars are circumpolar. Furthermore, the altitude of the celestial pole (and thus the average altitude of a circumpolar star circling it) is equal to the observer's latitude. Since latitude changes as we move north or south, the altitude of the celestial pole, and consequently, the altitude of a circumpolar star, also changes.\n",
