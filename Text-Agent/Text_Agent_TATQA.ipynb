Specifically, it mentions \"£1.5m (2018: £1.4m)...\" and \"£5.5m (2018: £1.0m loss)...\". Since the question asks about the years for which the net pension asset was *calculated*, and the information explicitly provides figures *for* 2018 and 2019 related to plan assets and returns, it is clear that calculations were performed for both those years in order to arrive at the figures presented.\n",

      "Answer: Answer: Fiscal 2019 operating expenses increased by 19.5% (15.2% in constant currency).\n",
      "Gold Evidence: The text states \"Fiscal 2019 operating expenses increased by 19.5% (15.2% in constant currency) mainly as a result of: • the impact of the MetroCast acquisition which was included in operating expenses for only an eight-month period in the prior year; • programming rate increases; • the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; • higher compensation expenses due to higher headcount to support growth; and • higher marketing initiatives to drive primary service units growth; partly offset by • the prior year's non-recurring costs of $3.1 million (US$2.5 million) related to hurricane Irma.\" This directly indicates the percentage increase in operating expenses for fiscal year 2019.\n",

      "Gold Evidence: The excerpt from Note 11 only describes characteristics of the \"Other Receivables\" balance, such as the fact that they are not past due or credit impaired and that their carrying amount approximates fair value.

      "Answer: Answer: Note 18.1 pertains to the fair values of currency and interest rate swap contracts, excluding accrued interest.\n",
      "Gold Evidence: The note explicitly states \"The fair values of the currency and interest rate swap contracts...\" and then provides additional information about these fair values, including the exclusion of accrued interest and where that interest is disclosed separately. The subsequent mention of \"The fair values of the derivative financial instruments\" further reinforces that the note is about fair value calculations and reporting of derivative financial instruments, specifically currency and interest rate swaps.\n",

      "Gold Evidence: The first sentence states \"A summary of our principal contractual financial obligations and commitments at 31 March 2019 are set out below.\" This explicitly declares that the purpose of the subsequent table is to present a summary of the company's financial obligations and commitments at that date.\n",

      "Answer: Answer: The decrease in research and development expenses in 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in research and development personnel, lower restructuring costs, and reduced professional fees.\n",
      "Gold Evidence: *   **Reduction in full-time research and development personnel:** The text states that \"the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of full-time research and development personnel.\" This directly indicates a primary reason for the expense decrease.\n",
      "*   **Decrease in compensation expense:** Because of the reduction in personnel, there was \"a decrease of $3.1 million in compensation expense.\" This means the company spent less on salaries and benefits related to research and development staff.\n",
      "*   **Decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs:** Reduced personnel also led to a \"decrease of $0.6 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs.\" This implies that with fewer employees, less office space and fewer IT resources were needed for research and development.\n",
      "*   **Lower professional fees:** The text says the decrease was \"further driven by lower professional fees of $0.6 million, as we reduced the number of research and development contractors as compared to 2018.\" This means the company spent less on fees paid to external research and development contractors.\n",
      "*   **No restructuring costs:** \"We did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.1 million was incurred.\" Although this amount is relatively small compared to the overall decrease, it still contributed to the decrease since these expenses were not present in 2019.\n",

      "Answer: Answer: The fair value position on notional £3,289m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.\n",
      "Gold Evidence: The text mentions that the notional amount of long-dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is £3,289m. It also mentions a related net cash inflow during the year of £129m. However, the £3,289m is the notional principal, not the fair value of the position.

      "Gold Evidence: To calculate the percentage change in depreciation expense from 2018 to 2019, we need to find the difference in depreciation expense between the two years and divide it by the depreciation expense in the base year (2018). From the provided Note 11, the depreciation expense for 2019 was $182.1 million, and the depreciation expense for 2018 was $165.2 million. The difference is $182.1 - $165.2 = $16.9 million. Then, we divide the difference by the 2018 depreciation expense: $16.9 / $165.2 = 0.1023. Multiplying by 100 to express this as a percentage gives us 10.23%.

Different jurisdictions have different freight tax laws, so changes in trading activity will directly affect which taxes the company is subject to.\n",
      "*   **Legal advice:** The passage mentions, \"Such information may include legal advice as to the applicability of freight taxes in relevant jurisdictions.\" This implies that the company relies on legal counsel to interpret and understand the tax laws in different jurisdictions.

The question specifies considering the change (increase or decrease) of each from March 2018 to March 2019. If accounts receivable and unbilled receivables increase, it implies more revenue has been recognized than cash collected, and thus increases the net balance, whereas if deferred revenue increases, it implies cash has been collected more than revenue recognized, and thus decreases the net balance.

      "*   **\"...of which $1.4 million, $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we were successful...\"** This further breaks down the total liability into a portion that would impact the effective tax rate, with values for each year, likely shown in another row of the table.\n",

      "Question: What are the different components of expenses?\n",
      "Answer: Answer: The components of expenses are vessel operating expenses, voyage, charterhire and commission expenses, administrative expenses, project development expenses, depreciation and amortization, other operating losses, and equity in net losses of affiliates.\n",
      "Gold Evidence: *   **Vessel operating expenses:** The text explicitly states \"The Hilli incurred $53.7 million of vessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019...\". This identifies vessel operating expenses as a distinct expense category.\n",
      "*   **Voyage, charterhire and commission expenses:** The text mentions \"The decrease in voyage, charterhire and commission expenses of $0.9 million to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019...\". This indicates voyage, charterhire and commission expenses are a separate category of expenses.\n",
      "*   **Administrative expenses:** The text states \"Administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019...\". This shows that administrative expenses are considered a unique expense item.\n",
      "*   **Project development expenses:** The text describes \"This relates to non-capitalized project-related expenses...\". This establishes project development expenses as a specific type of expense.\n",
      "*   **Depreciation and amortization:** The text says \"Following the Hilli's commencement of operations on May 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization of the vessel was recognized.\". Thus, depreciation and amortization are listed as an expense.\n",
      "*   **Other operating (losses)/gains:** The text says \"Included in other operating (losses)/gains are: ...\". This includes realized gain on the oil derivative instrument, unrealized loss on the oil derivative instrument, and write-off of unrecoverable receivables. This classifies \"Other operating losses\" as an expense.\n",
      "*   **Equity in net losses of affiliates:** The text states \"Equity in net losses of affiliates: In April 2018, we and Schlumberger decided to wind down OneLNG...\". This classifies equity in net losses of affiliates as an expense.\n",

      "Gold Evidence: The prompt states \"The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments (in millions):\" but does not provide the actual table.

      "Answer: Answer: The total available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments decreased by 16.6% from 2018 to 2019.\n",
      "Gold Evidence: The percentage change in total available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments is calculated as follows:\n",
      "1.  Find the difference between the total for 2019 and the total for 2018: $11 billion (2019) - $10 billion (2018) = $1 billion.\n",

Once we have those values, we subtract the 2018 value from the 2019 value.
