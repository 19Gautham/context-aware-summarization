We propose a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaboratively reason over diverse data modalities, enhancing the contextual understanding of tabular data. By integrating insights from multiple agents, our approach aims to improve both the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in tabular reasoning tasks. By distributing the workload across multiple agents, our approach enables a more structured and context-aware interpretation of tabular data.
