The files with a postfix of "retry" have logic written to retry only specific records.
The files (summaryAgent, testAgent, tableAgent) essentially execute specific prompts to score the closeness of the answer generated by the framework to the ground truth.
scoreFileGenerator.py is used to convert the files that are generated above into a file containing a list of JSON objects, are we regularly dump json objects to a file to avoid any loss due to some system failure.
The fiels with the rpefix "preprocess" are used to add some fields liek ground_truth and evidence from the dataset file to the result files generated by the individual agents, which is then passsd to the LLM for scoring.
